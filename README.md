# 3d_landmark_selection
Repo for developing GUI for season 10 3D pseudo GCP selection.

```
git clone https://github.com/phytooracle/3d_psuedo_GCP_selection.git
git clone https://github.com/phytooracle/phytooracle_data
cd 3d_psuedo_GCP_selection.git
cp sample.env .env
```

Edit .env so that it points to where you put the phytooracle_data repo, *and* where you want to (or already do) store data.
